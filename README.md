The objective of this project is to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch that will demonstrate my DOM skills. 

 I will be using various JavaScript methods and CSS Tools to create the project.

The project proved to be pretty challenging. I did get some help to start by creating the grid of div's, but one I got that rolling I did pretty well looking up how to add individual listening events to each div. 

The help that I did get from google, stack overflow etc. I made sure to understand what it was that I was doing and I feel I have a very good understanding of every bit of code that I created and pieced together. 

Added some styling to it and voila! Could be an ongoing project.
